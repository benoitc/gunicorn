# Docker Compose for Celery Replacement Example
#
# Notice: Only ONE service needed!
# Compare with typical Celery deployment which requires:
# - web (gunicorn/uvicorn)
# - celery_worker
# - celery_beat (for scheduled tasks)
# - redis or rabbitmq
#
# With dirty arbiters, everything runs in a single container.

# For comparison, here's what a Celery deployment would look like:
#
# services:
#   web:

#     command: gunicorn app:app -b 0.0.0.0:8000
#     ports:

#     depends_on:
#       - redis
#
#   celery_worker:
#     build: .
#     command: celery -A tasks worker -l info
#     depends_on:
#       - redis
#
#   celery_beat:
#     build: .
#     command: celery -A tasks beat -l info
#     depends_on:
#       - redis

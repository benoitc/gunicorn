We need to address CVE-2024-1135 with gunicorn. You can see the details of that in
this task: https://datarobot.atlassian.net/browse/DSX-3357. This has been out there 
for a long time already, so I am planning on skipping the PR to parent repo step, 
because there already is a PR there. This repo will be used to integrate that and
provide a package with the changes.

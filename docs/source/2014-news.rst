19.0 / 2014-06-12
=================

Gunicorn 19.0 is a major release with new features and fixes. This
version improve a lot the usage of Gunicorn with python 3 by adding `two
new workers <http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/design.html#asyncio-workers>`_
to it: `gthread` a fully threaded async worker using futures and `gaiohttp` a
worker using asyncio.


Breaking Changes
----------------

Switch QUIT and TERM signals
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

With this change, when gunicorn receives a QUIT all the workers are
killed immediately and exit and TERM is used for the graceful shutdown.

Note: the old behaviour was based on the NGINX but the new one is more
correct according the following doc:

https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Termination-Signals.html

also it is complying with the way the signals are sent by heroku:

Deprecations
++++++++++++

`run_gunicorn`, `gunicorn_django` and `gunicorn_paster` are now
completely deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Use the
`gunicorn` command instead.

core
++++

- add aiohttp worker named `gaiohttp` using asyncio. Full async worker

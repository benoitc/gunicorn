Changelog - 2024
================

23.0.0 - 2024-08-10
===================

- minor docs fixes (:pr:`3217`, :pr:`3089`, :pr:`3167`)
- worker_class parameter accepts a class (:pr:`3079`)
- fix deadlock if request terminated during chunked parsing (:pr:`2688`)
- permit receiving Transfer-Encodings: compress, deflate, gzip (:pr:`3261`)
- permit Transfer-Encoding headers specifying multiple encodings. note: no parameters, still (:pr:`3261`)
- sdist generation now explicitly excludes sphinx build folder (:pr:`3257`)
- decode bytes-typed status (as can be passed by gevent) as utf-8 instead of raising `TypeError` (:pr:`2336`)
- raise correct Exception when encounting invalid chunked requests (:pr:`3258`)
- the SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO headers, when received from allowed forwarders, are no longer restricted for containing an underscore (:pr:`3192`)
- include IPv6 loopback address ``[::1]`` in default for :ref:`forwarded-allow-ips` and :ref:`proxy-allow-ips` (:pr:`3192`)

** NOTE **

- The SCRIPT_NAME change mitigates a regression that appeared first in the 22.0.0 release
- Review your :ref:`forwarded-allow-ips` setting if you are still not seeing the SCRIPT_NAME transmitted
- Review your :ref:`forwarder-headers` setting if you are missing headers after upgrading from a version prior to 22.0.0

** Breaking changes **

- refuse requests where the uri field is empty (:pr:`3255`)
- refuse requests with invalid CR/LR/NUL in heade field values (:pr:`3253`)
- remove temporary ``--tolerate-dangerous-framing`` switch from 22.0 (:pr:`3260`)
- If any of the breaking changes affect you, be aware that now refused requests can post a security problem, especially so in setups involving request pipe-lining and/or proxies.

22.0.0 - 2024-04-17
===================

- use `utime` to notify workers liveness 
- migrate setup to pyproject.toml
- fix numerous security vulnerabilities in HTTP parser (closing some request smuggling vectors)
- parsing additional requests is no longer attempted past unsupported request framing
- on HTTP versions < 1.1 support for chunked transfer is refused (only used in exploits)
- requests conflicting configured or passed SCRIPT_NAME now produce a verbose error
- Trailer fields are no longer inspected for headers indicating secure scheme
- support Python 3.12

** Breaking changes **

- minimum version is Python 3.7
- the limitations on valid characters in the HTTP method have been bounded to Internet Standards
- requests specifying unsupported transfer coding (order) are refused by default (rare)
- HTTP methods are no longer casefolded by default (IANA method registry contains none affected)
- HTTP methods containing the number sign (#) are no longer accepted by default (rare)
- HTTP versions < 1.0 or >= 2.0 are no longer accepted by default (rare, only HTTP/1.1 is supported)
- HTTP versions consisting of multiple digits or containing a prefix/suffix are no longer accepted
- HTTP header field names Gunicorn cannot safely map to variables are silently dropped, as in other software
- HTTP headers with empty field name are refused by default (no legitimate use cases, used in exploits)
- requests with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length are refused by default (such a message might indicate an attempt to perform request smuggling)
- empty transfer codings are no longer permitted (reportedly seen with really old & broken proxies)


** SECURITY **

- fix CVE-2024-1135

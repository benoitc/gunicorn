Settings
========

This is an exhaustive list of settings for Gunicorn. Some settings are only
able to be set from a configuration file. The setting name is what should be
used in the configuration file. The command line arguments are listed as well
for reference on setting at the command line.

.. note::

    Settings can be specified by using environment variable
    ``GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS``. All available command line arguments can be used.
    For example, to specify the bind address and number of workers::

        $ GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS="--bind=127.0.0.1 --workers=3" gunicorn app:app

    .. versionadded:: 19.7

Config File
-----------

.. _config:

``config``
~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``-c CONFIG`` or ``--config CONFIG``

**Default:** ``'./gunicorn.conf.py'``

:ref:`The Gunicorn config file<configuration_file>`.

A string of the form ``PATH``, ``file:PATH``, or ``python:MODULE_NAME``.

Only has an effect when specified on the command line or as part of an
application specific configuration.

By default, a file named ``gunicorn.conf.py`` will be read from the same
directory where gunicorn is being run.

.. versionchanged:: 19.4
   Loading the config from a Python module requires the ``python:``
   prefix.

.. _wsgi-app:

``wsgi_app``

Restart workers when code changes.

This setting is intended for development. It will cause workers to be
restarted whenever application code changes.

The reloader is incompatible with application preloading. When using a
paste configuration be sure that the server block does not import any
application code or the reload will not work as designed.

The default behavior is to attempt inotify with a fallback to file
system polling. Generally, inotify should be preferred if available
because it consumes less system resources.

.. note::
   In order to use the inotify reloader, you must have the ``inotify``
   package installed.

.. _reload-engine:

``reload_engine``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--reload-engine STRING``

**Default:** ``'auto'``

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--limit-request-line INT``

**Default:** ``4094``

The maximum size of HTTP request line in bytes.

This parameter is used to limit the allowed size of a client's
HTTP request-line. Since the request-line consists of the HTTP
method, URI, and protocol version, this directive places a
restriction on the length of a request-URI allowed for a request
on the server. A server needs this value to be large enough to
hold any of its resource names, including any information that
might be passed in the query part of a GET request. Value is a number
from 0 (unlimited) to 8190.

This parameter can be used to prevent any DDOS attack.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--limit-request-fields INT``

**Default:** ``100``

Limit the number of HTTP headers fields in a request.

This parameter is used to limit the number of headers in a request to
prevent DDOS attack. Used with the *limit_request_field_size* it allows
more safety. By default this value is 100 and can't be larger than
32768.

.. _limit-request-field-size:

``limit_request_field_size``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--limit-request-field_size INT``

**Default:** ``8190``

Limit the allowed size of an HTTP request header field.

Value is a positive number or 0. Setting it to 0 will allow unlimited
header field sizes.

.. warning::
   Setting this parameter to a very high or unlimited value can open
   up for DDOS attacks.

``secure_scheme_headers``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Default:** ``{'X-FORWARDED-PROTOCOL': 'ssl', 'X-FORWARDED-PROTO': 'https', 'X-FORWARDED-SSL': 'on'}``

A dictionary containing headers and values that the front-end proxy
uses to indicate HTTPS requests. If the source IP is permitted by
``forwarded-allow-ips`` (below), *and* at least one request header matches
a key-value pair listed in this dictionary, then Gunicorn will set
``wsgi.url_scheme`` to ``https``, so your application can tell that the
request is secure.

If the other headers listed in this dictionary are not present in the request, they will be ignored,
but if the other headers are present and do not match the provided values, then
the request will fail to parse. See the note below for more detailed examples of this behaviour.

The dictionary should map upper-case header names to exact string
values. The value comparisons are case-sensitive, unlike the header
names, so make sure they're exactly what your front-end proxy sends
when handling HTTPS requests.

It is important that your front-end proxy configuration ensures that
the headers defined here can not be passed directly from the client.

.. _forwarded-allow-ips:

``forwarded_allow_ips``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--forwarded-allow-ips STRING``

**Default:** ``'127.0.0.1'``

Front-end's IPs from which allowed to handle set secure headers.
(comma separate).

Set to ``*`` to disable checking of Front-end IPs (useful for setups
where you don't know in advance the IP address of Front-end, but
you still trust the environment).

By default, the value of the ``FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`` environment
variable. If it is not defined, the default is ``"127.0.0.1"``.

.. note::

    The interplay between the request headers, the value of ``forwarded_allow_ips``, and the value of
    ``secure_scheme_headers`` is complex. Various scenarios are documented below to further elaborate.
    In each case, we have a request from the remote address 134.213.44.18, and the default value of
    ``secure_scheme_headers``:

    .. code::

        secure_scheme_headers = {
            'X-FORWARDED-PROTOCOL': 'ssl',
            'X-FORWARDED-PROTO': 'https',
            'X-FORWARDED-SSL': 'on'
        }


    .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :align: center
        :widths: auto

        * - ``forwarded-allow-ips``
          - Secure Request Headers
          - Result
          - Explanation
        * - .. code::

                ["127.0.0.1"]
          - .. code::

                X-Forwarded-Proto: https
          - .. code::

                wsgi.url_scheme = "http"
          - IP address was not allowed
        * - .. code::

                "*"
          - <none>
          - .. code::

                wsgi.url_scheme = "http"
          - IP address allowed, but no secure headers provided
        * - .. code::

                "*"
          - .. code::

                X-Forwarded-Proto: https
          - .. code::

                wsgi.url_scheme = "https"
          - IP address allowed, one request header matched
        * - .. code::

                ["134.213.44.18"]
          - .. code::

                X-Forwarded-Ssl: on
                X-Forwarded-Proto: http
          - ``InvalidSchemeHeaders()`` raised
          - IP address allowed, but the two secure headers disagreed on if HTTPS was used

.. _pythonpath:

``pythonpath``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--pythonpath STRING``

**Default:** ``None``

A comma-separated list of directories to add to the Python path.

e.g.
``'/home/djangoprojects/myproject,/home/python/mylibrary'``.

.. _paste:

``paste``
~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--paste STRING`` or ``--paster STRING``

**Default:** ``None``

Load a PasteDeploy config file. The argument may contain a ``#``
symbol followed by the name of an app section from the config file,
e.g. ``production.ini#admin``.

At this time, using alternate server blocks is not supported. Use the
command line arguments to control server configuration instead.

.. _proxy-protocol:

``proxy_protocol``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--proxy-protocol``

**Default:** ``False``

Enable detect PROXY protocol (PROXY mode).

Allow using HTTP and Proxy together. It may be useful for work with
stunnel as HTTPS frontend and Gunicorn as HTTP server.

PROXY protocol: http://haproxy.1wt.eu/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt

Example for stunnel config::

    [https]
    protocol = proxy
    accept  = 443
    connect = 80
    cert = /etc/ssl/certs/stunnel.pem
    key = /etc/ssl/certs/stunnel.key

.. _proxy-allow-ips:

``proxy_allow_ips``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--proxy-allow-from``

**Default:** ``'127.0.0.1'``

Front-end's IPs from which allowed accept proxy requests (comma separate).

Set to ``*`` to disable checking of Front-end IPs (useful for setups
where you don't know in advance the IP address of Front-end, but
you still trust the environment)

.. _raw-paste-global-conf:

``raw_paste_global_conf``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--paste-global CONF``

**Default:** ``[]``

Set a PasteDeploy global config variable in ``key=value`` form.

The option can be specified multiple times.

The variables are passed to the the PasteDeploy entrypoint. Example::

    $ gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:8000 --paste development.ini --paste-global FOO=1 --paste-global BAR=2

.. versionadded:: 19.7

.. _strip-header-spaces:

``strip_header_spaces``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--strip-header-spaces``

**Default:** ``False``

Strip spaces present between the header name and the the ``:``.

This is known to induce vulnerabilities and is not compliant with the HTTP/1.1 standard.
See https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn.

Use with care and only if necessary.

Server Socket
-------------

.. _bind:

``bind``
~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``-b ADDRESS`` or ``--bind ADDRESS``

**Default:** ``['127.0.0.1:8000']``

The socket to bind.

A string of the form: ``HOST``, ``HOST:PORT``, ``unix:PATH``,
``fd://FD``. An IP is a valid ``HOST``.

.. versionchanged:: 20.0
   Support for ``fd://FD`` got added.

Multiple addresses can be bound. ex.::

    $ gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:8000 -b [::1]:8000 test:app

will bind the `test:app` application on localhost both on ipv6
and ipv4 interfaces.

If the ``PORT`` environment variable is defined, the default
is ``['0.0.0.0:$PORT']``. If it is not defined, the default
is ``['127.0.0.1:8000']``.

.. _backlog:

``backlog``
~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--backlog INT``

**Default:** ``2048``

The maximum number of pending connections.

This refers to the number of clients that can be waiting to be served.
Exceeding this number results in the client getting an error when
attempting to connect. It should only affect servers under significant
load.

Must be a positive integer. Generally set in the 64-2048 range.

Worker Processes
----------------

.. _workers:

``workers``
~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``-w INT`` or ``--workers INT``

**Default:** ``1``

The number of worker processes for handling requests.

A positive integer generally in the ``2-4 x $(NUM_CORES)`` range.
You'll want to vary this a bit to find the best for your particular
application's work load.

By default, the value of the ``WEB_CONCURRENCY`` environment variable,
which is set by some Platform-as-a-Service providers such as Heroku. If
it is not defined, the default is ``1``.

.. _worker-class:

``worker_class``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``-k STRING`` or ``--worker-class STRING``

**Default:** ``'sync'``

The type of workers to use.

The default class (``sync``) should handle most "normal" types of
workloads. You'll want to read :doc:`design` for information on when
you might want to choose one of the other worker classes. Required
libraries may be installed using setuptools' ``extras_require`` feature.

A string referring to one of the following bundled classes:

* ``sync``
* ``eventlet`` - Requires eventlet >= 0.24.1 (or install it via
  ``pip install gunicorn[eventlet]``)
* ``gevent``   - Requires gevent >= 1.4 (or install it via
  ``pip install gunicorn[gevent]``)
* ``tornado``  - Requires tornado >= 0.2 (or install it via
  ``pip install gunicorn[tornado]``)
* ``gthread``  - Python 2 requires the futures package to be installed
  (or install it via ``pip install gunicorn[gthread]``)

Optionally, you can provide your own worker by giving Gunicorn a
Python path to a subclass of ``gunicorn.workers.base.Worker``.
This alternative syntax will load the gevent class:
``gunicorn.workers.ggevent.GeventWorker``.

.. _threads:

``threads``
~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--threads INT``

**Default:** ``1``

The number of worker threads for handling requests.

Run each worker with the specified number of threads.

A positive integer generally in the ``2-4 x $(NUM_CORES)`` range.
You'll want to vary this a bit to find the best for your particular
application's work load.

If it is not defined, the default is ``1``.

This setting only affects the Gthread worker type.

.. note::
   If you try to use the ``sync`` worker type and set the ``threads``
   setting to more than 1, the ``gthread`` worker type will be used
   instead.

.. _worker-connections:

``worker_connections``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--worker-connections INT``

**Default:** ``1000``

The maximum number of simultaneous clients.

This setting only affects the ``gthread``, ``eventlet`` and ``gevent`` worker types.

.. _max-requests:

``max_requests``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--max-requests INT``

**Default:** ``0``

The maximum number of requests a worker will process before restarting.

Any value greater than zero will limit the number of requests a worker
will process before automatically restarting. This is a simple method
to help limit the damage of memory leaks.

If this is set to zero (the default) then the automatic worker
restarts are disabled.

.. _max-requests-jitter:

``max_requests_jitter``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--max-requests-jitter INT``

**Default:** ``0``

The maximum jitter to add to the *max_requests* setting.

The jitter causes the restart per worker to be randomized by
``randint(0, max_requests_jitter)``. This is intended to stagger worker
restarts to avoid all workers restarting at the same time.

.. versionadded:: 19.2

.. _timeout:

``timeout``
~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``-t INT`` or ``--timeout INT``

**Default:** ``30``

Workers silent for more than this many seconds are killed and restarted.

Value is a positive number or 0. Setting it to 0 has the effect of
infinite timeouts by disabling timeouts for all workers entirely.

Generally, the default of thirty seconds should suffice. Only set this
noticeably higher if you're sure of the repercussions for sync workers.
For the non sync workers it just means that the worker process is still
communicating and is not tied to the length of time required to handle a
single request.

.. _graceful-timeout:

``graceful_timeout``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--graceful-timeout INT``

**Default:** ``30``

Timeout for graceful workers restart.

After receiving a restart signal, workers have this much time to finish
serving requests. Workers still alive after the timeout (starting from
the receipt of the restart signal) are force killed.

.. _keepalive:

``keepalive``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Command line:** ``--keep-alive INT``

**Default:** ``2``

The number of seconds to wait for requests on a Keep-Alive connection.

Generally set in the 1-5 seconds range for servers with direct connection
to the client (e.g. when you don't have separate load balancer). When
Gunicorn is deployed behind a load balancer, it often makes sense to
set this to a higher value.

.. note::
   ``sync`` worker does not support persistent connections and will
   ignore this option.

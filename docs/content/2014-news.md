## 19.0 / 2014-06-12

Gunicorn 19.0 is a major release with new features and fixes. This
version improve a lot the usage of Gunicorn with python 3 by adding `two
new workers <http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/design.html#asyncio-workers>`_
to it: `gthread` a fully threaded async worker using futures and `gaiohttp` a
worker using asyncio.


### Breaking Changes

### Switch QUIT and TERM signals

With this change, when gunicorn receives a QUIT all the workers are
killed immediately and exit and TERM is used for the graceful shutdown.

Note: the old behaviour was based on the NGINX but the new one is more
correct according the following doc:

https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Termination-Signals.html

also it is complying with the way the signals are sent by heroku:

https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-faq#what-constraints-exist-when-developing-applications-on-heroku

### Deprecations

`run_gunicorn`, `gunicorn_django` and `gunicorn_paster` are now
completely deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Use the
`gunicorn` command instead.


### Changes

### core

- add aiohttp worker named `gaiohttp` using asyncio. Full async worker
  on python 3.
- fix HTTP-violating excess whitespace in write_error output
- fix: try to log what happened in the worker after a timeout, add a
  `worker_abort` hook on SIGABRT signal.
- fix: save listener socket name in workers so we can handle buffered
  keep-alive requests after the listener has closed.
- add on_exit hook called just before exiting gunicorn.
- add support for python 3.4
- fix: do not swallow unexpected errors when reaping
- fix: remove incompatible SSL option with python 2.6
- add new async gthread worker and `--threads` options allows to set multiple
  threads to listen on connection
- deprecate `gunicorn_django` and `gunicorn_paster`

- reap workers in SIGCHLD handler
- add universal wheel support
- use `email.utils.formatdate` in gunicorn.util.http_date
- deprecate the `--debug` option
- fix: log exceptions that occur after response start â€¦
- allows loading of applications from `.pyc` files (#693)
- fix: issue #691, raw_env config file parsing
- use a dynamic timeout to wait for the optimal time. (Reduce power
  usage)

  setups.
- add: include tz offset in access log
- add: include access logs in the syslog handler.

- fix: handle_error
- add more option to configure SSL
- fix: sendfile with SSL
- add: worker_int callback (to react on SIGTERM)

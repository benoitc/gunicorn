  using TLV (Type-Length-Value) encoding
  ([PR #3500](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3500))
  - More efficient than JSON for binary data
  - Supports all Python types: str, bytes, int, float, bool, None, list, dict
  - Better performance for large payloads

  ([PR #3504](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3504))
  - Send SIGTTIN to increase dirty workers
  - Send SIGTTOU to decrease dirty workers
  - Respects minimum worker constraints from app configurations

### Changes

- **ASGI Worker**: Promoted from beta to stable
- **Dirty Arbiters**: Now marked as beta feature

### Documentation

- Fix Markdown formatting in /configure documentation

---

## 25.0.3 - 2026-02-07

### Bug Fixes

- Fix RuntimeError when StopIteration is raised inside ASGI response body
  coroutine (PEP 479 compliance)

- Fix deprecation warning for passing maxsplit as positional argument in
  `re.split()` (Python 3.13+)

---

## 25.0.2 - 2026-02-06

### Bug Fixes

- Fix ASGI concurrent request failures through nginx proxy by normalizing
  sockaddr tuples to handle both 2-tuple (IPv4) and 4-tuple (IPv6) formats
  ([PR #3485](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3485))

- Fix graceful disconnect handling for ASGI worker to properly handle
  client disconnects without raising exceptions
  ([PR #3485](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3485))

- Fix lazy import of dirty module for gevent compatibility - prevents
  import errors when concurrent.futures is imported before gevent monkey-patching
  ([PR #3483](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3483))

### Changes

- Refactor: Extract `_normalize_sockaddr` utility function for consistent
  socket address handling across workers

- Add license headers to all Python source files

- Update copyright year to 2026 in LICENSE and NOTICE files

---

## 25.0.1 - 2026-02-02

### Bug Fixes

- Fix ASGI streaming responses (SSE) hanging: add chunked transfer encoding for
  HTTP/1.1 responses without Content-Length header. Without chunked encoding,
  clients wait for connection close to determine end-of-response.

### Changes

- Update celery_alternative example to use FastAPI with native ASGI worker and
  uvloop for async task execution

### Testing

- Add ASGI compliance test suite with Docker-based integration tests covering HTTP,
  WebSocket, streaming, lifespan, framework integration (Starlette, FastAPI),
  HTTP/2, and concurrency scenarios

## 25.0.0 - 2026-02-01

### New Features

- **Dirty Arbiters**: Separate process pool for executing long-running, blocking
  operations (AI model loading, heavy computation) without blocking HTTP workers
  ([PR #3460](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3460))
  - Inspired by Erlang's dirty schedulers
  - Asyncio-based with Unix socket IPC
  - Stateful workers that persist loaded resources
  - New settings: `--dirty-app`, `--dirty-workers`, `--dirty-timeout`,
    `--dirty-threads`, `--dirty-graceful-timeout`
  - Lifecycle hooks: `on_dirty_starting`, `dirty_post_fork`,
    `dirty_worker_init`, `dirty_worker_exit`

- **Per-App Worker Allocation for Dirty Arbiters**: Control how many dirty workers
  load each app for memory optimization with heavy models
  ([PR #3473](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3473))
  - Set `workers` class attribute on DirtyApp (e.g., `workers = 2`)
  - Or use config format `module:class:N` (e.g., `myapp:HeavyModel:2`)
  - Requests automatically routed to workers with the target app
  - New exception `DirtyNoWorkersAvailableError` for graceful error handling
  - Example: 8 workers × 10GB model = 80GB → with `workers=2`: 20GB (75% savings)

- **HTTP/2 Support (Beta)**: Native HTTP/2 (RFC 7540) support for improved performance
  with modern clients ([PR #3468](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3468))
  - Multiplexed streams over a single connection
  - Header compression (HPACK)
  - Flow control and stream prioritization
  - Works with gthread, gevent, and ASGI workers
  - New settings: `--http-protocols`, `--http2-max-concurrent-streams`,
    `--http2-initial-window-size`, `--http2-max-frame-size`, `--http2-max-header-list-size`
  - Requires SSL/TLS and h2 library: `pip install gunicorn[http2]`
  - See [HTTP/2 Guide](guides/http2.md) for details
  - New example: `examples/http2_gevent/` with Docker and tests

- **HTTP 103 Early Hints**: Support for RFC 8297 Early Hints to enable browsers to
  preload resources before the final response
  ([PR #3468](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3468))
  - WSGI: `environ['wsgi.early_hints'](headers)` callback
  - ASGI: `http.response.informational` message type
  - Works with both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2

- **uWSGI Protocol for ASGI Worker**: The ASGI worker now supports receiving requests
  via the uWSGI binary protocol from nginx
  ([PR #3467](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3467))

### Bug Fixes

- Fix HTTP/2 ALPN negotiation for gevent and eventlet workers when
  `do_handshake_on_connect` is False (the default). The TLS handshake is now
  explicitly performed before checking `selected_alpn_protocol()`.

- Fix setproctitle initialization with systemd socket activation
  ([#3465](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/issues/3465))

- Fix `Expect: 100-continue` handling: ignore the header for HTTP/1.0 requests
  since 100-continue is only valid for HTTP/1.1+
  ([PR #3463](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3463))

- Fix missing `_expected_100_continue` attribute in UWSGIRequest

- Disable setproctitle on macOS to prevent segfaults during process title updates

- Publish full exception traceback when the application fails to load
  ([#3462](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/issues/3462))

### Deprecations

- **Eventlet Worker**: The `eventlet` worker is deprecated and will be removed in
  Gunicorn 26.0. Eventlet itself is [no longer actively maintained](https://eventlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/asyncio/migration.html).
  Please migrate to `gevent`, `gthread`, or another supported worker type.

### Changes

- Remove obsolete Makefile targets
  ([PR #3471](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3471))

---

## 24.1.1 - 2026-01-24

### Bug Fixes

- Fix `forwarded_allow_ips` and `proxy_allow_ips` to remain as strings for backward
  compatibility with external tools like uvicorn. Network validation now uses strict
  mode to detect invalid CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.1/24` where host bits are set)
  ([#3458](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/issues/3458),
  [PR #3459](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3459))

---

## 24.1.0 - 2026-01-23

### New Features

- **Official Docker Image**: Gunicorn now publishes official Docker images to GitHub
  Container Registry at `ghcr.io/benoitc/gunicorn`
  - Based on Python 3.12 slim image
  - Uses recommended worker formula (2 × CPU + 1)
  - Configurable via environment variables

- **PROXY Protocol v2 Support**: Extended PROXY protocol implementation to support
  the binary v2 format in addition to the existing text-based v1 format
  ([PR #3451](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3451))
  - New `--proxy-protocol` modes: `off`, `v1`, `v2`, `auto`
  - `auto` mode (default when enabled) detects v1 or v2 automatically
  - v2 binary format is more efficient and supports additional metadata
  - Works with HAProxy, AWS NLB/ALB, and other PROXY protocol v2 sources

- **CIDR Network Support**: `--forwarded-allow-ips` and `--proxy-allow-from` now
  accept CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.0.0/16`) for specifying trusted networks
  ([PR #3449](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3449))

- **Socket Backlog Metric**: New `gunicorn.socket.backlog` gauge metric reports
  the current socket backlog size on Linux systems
  ([PR #3450](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3450))

- **InotifyReloader Enhancement**: The inotify-based reloader now watches newly
  imported modules, not just those loaded at startup
  ([PR #3447](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3447))

### Bug Fixes

- Fix signal handling regression where SIGCLD alias caused "Unhandled signal: cld"
  errors on Linux when workers fail during boot
  ([#3453](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/discussions/3453))

  slow or abandoned connections
  ([PR #3453](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3453))

- Handle `SSLWantReadError` in `finish_body()` to prevent worker hangs during
  SSL renegotiation
  ([PR #3448](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3448))

- Log SIGTERM as info level instead of warning to reduce noise in orchestrated
  environments
  ([PR #3446](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3446))

- Print exception details to stderr when worker fails to boot
  ([PR #3443](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3443))

- Fix `unreader.unread()` to prepend data to buffer instead of appending
  ([PR #3442](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3442))

- Prevent `RecursionError` when pickling Config objects
  ([PR #3441](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3441))

- Use proper exception chaining with `raise from` in glogging.py
  ([PR #3440](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/3440))

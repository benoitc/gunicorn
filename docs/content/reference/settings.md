# Config File

## `config`

**Command line:** `-c CONFIG`, `--config CONFIG`

**Default:** `'./gunicorn.conf.py'`

[The Gunicorn config file](../configure.md#configuration-file).

A string of the form ``PATH``, ``file:PATH``, or ``python:MODULE_NAME``.

Only has an effect when specified on the command line or as part of an
application specific configuration.

By default, a file named ``gunicorn.conf.py`` will be read from the same
directory where gunicorn is being run.

!!! info "Changed in 19.4"
    Loading the config from a Python module requires the ``python:``
    prefix.

## `wsgi_app`

**Default:** `None`

A WSGI application path in pattern ``$(MODULE_NAME):$(VARIABLE_NAME)``.

!!! info "Added in 20.1.0"

# Debugging

## `reload`

**Command line:** `--reload`

**Default:** `False`

Restart workers when code changes.

This setting is intended for development. It will cause workers to be
restarted whenever application code changes.

The reloader is incompatible with application preloading. When using a
paste configuration be sure that the server block does not import any
application code or the reload will not work as designed.

The default behavior is to attempt inotify with a fallback to file
system polling. Generally, inotify should be preferred if available
because it consumes less system resources.

!!! note
    In order to use the inotify reloader, you must have the ``inotify``
    package installed.

## `reload_engine`

**Command line:** `--reload-engine STRING`

**Default:** `'auto'`

The implementation that should be used to power [reload](#reload).

**Default:** `None`

The log config file to use.
Gunicorn uses the standard Python logging module's Configuration
file format.

## `logconfig_dict`

**Default:** `{}`

The log config dictionary to use, using the standard Python
logging module's dictionary configuration format. This option
takes precedence over the [logconfig](#logconfig) and [logconfig-json](#logconfig_json) options,

# Process Naming

## `proc_name`

**Command line:** `-n STRING`, `--name STRING`

**Default:** `None`

A base to use with setproctitle for process naming.

This affects things like ``ps`` and ``top``. If you're going to be
running more than one instance of Gunicorn you'll probably want to set a
name to tell them apart. This requires that you install the setproctitle
module.

If not set, the *default_proc_name* setting will be used.

which contains ciphers considered strong at the time of each Python
release.

As a recommended alternative, the Open Web App Security Project (OWASP)
offers `a vetted set of strong cipher strings rated A+ to C-
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/TLS_Cipher_String_Cheat_Sheet>`_.
OWASP provides details on user-agent compatibility at each security level.

See the `OpenSSL Cipher List Format Documentation
<https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/ciphers.html#CIPHER-LIST-FORMAT>`_
for details on the format of an OpenSSL cipher list.

# Security

## `limit_request_line`

**Command line:** `--limit-request-line INT`

**Default:** `4094`

The maximum size of HTTP request line in bytes.

This parameter is used to limit the allowed size of a client's
HTTP request-line. Since the request-line consists of the HTTP
method, URI, and protocol version, this directive places a
restriction on the length of a request-URI allowed for a request
on the server. A server needs this value to be large enough to
hold any of its resource names, including any information that
might be passed in the query part of a GET request. Value is a number
from 0 (unlimited) to 8190.

This parameter can be used to prevent any DDOS attack.

## `limit_request_fields`

**Command line:** `--limit-request-fields INT`

**Default:** `100`

Limit the number of HTTP headers fields in a request.

This parameter is used to limit the number of headers in a request to
prevent DDOS attack. Used with the *limit_request_field_size* it allows
more safety. By default this value is 100 and can't be larger than
32768.

## `limit_request_field_size`

**Command line:** `--limit-request-field_size INT`

**Default:** `8190`

Limit the allowed size of an HTTP request header field.

Value is a positive number or 0. Setting it to 0 will allow unlimited
header field sizes.

!!! warning
    Setting this parameter to a very high or unlimited value can open
    up for DDOS attacks.

!!! info "Added in 21.0"

# Server Mechanics

## `preload_app`

**Command line:** `--preload`

**Default:** `False`

Load application code before the worker processes are forked.

By preloading an application you can save some RAM resources as well as
speed up server boot times. Although, if you defer application loading
to each worker process, you can reload your application code easily by
restarting workers.

## `sendfile`

**Command line:** `--no-sendfile`

**Default:** `None`

Disables the use of ``sendfile()``.

If not set, the value of the ``SENDFILE`` environment variable is used

Detaches the server from the controlling terminal and enters the
background.

## `raw_env`

**Command line:** `-e ENV`, `--env ENV`

**Default:** `[]`

Set environment variables in the execution environment.

Should be a list of strings in the ``key=value`` format.

For example on the command line:

```console
$ gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:8000 --env FOO=1 test:app
```

Or in the configuration file:

```python
raw_env = ["FOO=1"]
```

## `pidfile`

**Command line:** `-p FILE`, `--pid FILE`

**Default:** `None`

A filename to use for the PID file.

If not set, no PID file will be written.

## `worker_tmp_dir`

**Command line:** `--worker-tmp-dir DIR`

**Default:** `None`

A directory to use for the worker heartbeat temporary file.

If not set, the default temporary directory will be used.

!!! note
    The current heartbeat system involves calling ``os.fchmod`` on
    temporary file handlers and may block a worker for arbitrary time
    if the directory is on a disk-backed filesystem.

    See [blocking-os-fchmod](#blocking_os_fchmod) for more detailed information
    and a solution for avoiding this problem.

## `user`

**Command line:** `-u USER`, `--user USER`

**Default:**

``os.geteuid()``

Switch worker processes to run as this user.

A valid user id (as an integer) or the name of a user that can be
retrieved with a call to ``pwd.getpwnam(value)`` or ``None`` to not
change the worker process user.

## `group`

**Command line:** `-g GROUP`, `--group GROUP`

**Default:**

``os.getegid()``

Switch worker process to run as this group.

A valid group id (as an integer) or the name of a user that can be
retrieved with a call to ``grp.getgrnam(value)`` or ``None`` to not
change the worker processes group.

## `umask`

**Command line:** `-m INT`, `--umask INT`

**Default:** `0`

A bit mask for the file mode on files written by Gunicorn.

Note that this affects unix socket permissions.

A valid value for the ``os.umask(mode)`` call or a string compatible
with ``int(value, 0)`` (``0`` means Python guesses the base, so values
like ``0``, ``0xFF``, ``0022`` are valid for decimal, hex, and octal
representations)

## `initgroups`

**Command line:** `--initgroups`

**Default:** `False`

If true, set the worker process's group access list with all of the
groups of which the specified username is a member, plus the specified
group id.

!!! info "Added in 19.7"

## `tmp_upload_dir`

**Default:** `None`

Directory to store temporary request data as they are read.

This may disappear in the near future.

This path should be writable by the process permissions set for Gunicorn
workers. If not specified, Gunicorn will choose a system generated
temporary directory.

## `secure_scheme_headers`

**Default:** `{'X-FORWARDED-PROTOCOL': 'ssl', 'X-FORWARDED-PROTO': 'https', 'X-FORWARDED-SSL': 'on'}`

A dictionary containing headers and values that the front-end proxy
uses to indicate HTTPS requests. If the source IP is permitted by
[forwarded-allow-ips](#forwarded_allow_ips) (below), *and* at least one request header matches
a key-value pair listed in this dictionary, then Gunicorn will set
``wsgi.url_scheme`` to ``https``, so your application can tell that the
request is secure.

If the other headers listed in this dictionary are not present in the request, they will be ignored,
but if the other headers are present and do not match the provided values, then
the request will fail to parse. See the note below for more detailed examples of this behaviour.

The dictionary should map upper-case header names to exact string
values. The value comparisons are case-sensitive, unlike the header
names, so make sure they're exactly what your front-end proxy sends
when handling HTTPS requests.

It is important that your front-end proxy configuration ensures that
the headers defined here can not be passed directly from the client.

## `forwarded_allow_ips`

**Command line:** `--forwarded-allow-ips STRING`

**Default:** `'127.0.0.1,::1'`

Front-end's IPs from which allowed to handle set secure headers.
(comma separated).

Set to ``*`` to disable checking of front-end IPs. This is useful for setups
where you don't know in advance the IP address of front-end, but
instead have ensured via other means that only your
authorized front-ends can access Gunicorn.

By default, the value of the ``FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`` environment
variable. If it is not defined, the default is ``"127.0.0.1,::1"``.

!!! note
    This option does not affect UNIX socket connections. Connections not associated with
    an IP address are treated as allowed, unconditionally.

!!! note
    The interplay between the request headers, the value of ``forwarded_allow_ips``, and the value of
    ``secure_scheme_headers`` is complex. Various scenarios are documented below to further elaborate.
    In each case, we have a request from the remote address 134.213.44.18, and the default value of
    ``secure_scheme_headers``:

    .. code::

        secure_scheme_headers = {
            'X-FORWARDED-PROTOCOL': 'ssl',
            'X-FORWARDED-PROTO': 'https',
            'X-FORWARDED-SSL': 'on'
        }

          - ``InvalidSchemeHeaders()`` raised
          - IP address allowed, but the two secure headers disagreed on if HTTPS was used

## `pythonpath`

**Command line:** `--pythonpath STRING`

**Default:** `None`

A comma-separated list of directories to add to the Python path.

e.g.
``'/home/djangoprojects/myproject,/home/python/mylibrary'``.

## `paste`

**Command line:** `--paste STRING`, `--paster STRING`

**Default:** `None`

Load a PasteDeploy config file. The argument may contain a ``#``
symbol followed by the name of an app section from the config file,
e.g. ``production.ini#admin``.

At this time, using alternate server blocks is not supported. Use the
command line arguments to control server configuration instead.

## `proxy_protocol`

**Command line:** `--proxy-protocol`

**Default:** `False`

Enable detect PROXY protocol (PROXY mode).

Allow using HTTP and Proxy together. It may be useful for work with
stunnel as HTTPS frontend and Gunicorn as HTTP server.

PROXY protocol: http://haproxy.1wt.eu/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt

Example for stunnel config::

    [https]
    protocol = proxy
    accept  = 443
    connect = 80
    cert = /etc/ssl/certs/stunnel.pem
    key = /etc/ssl/certs/stunnel.key

## `proxy_allow_ips`

**Command line:** `--proxy-allow-from`

**Default:** `'127.0.0.1,::1'`

Front-end's IPs from which allowed accept proxy requests (comma separated).

Set to ``*`` to disable checking of front-end IPs. This is useful for setups
where you don't know in advance the IP address of front-end, but
instead have ensured via other means that only your
authorized front-ends can access Gunicorn.

!!! note
    This option does not affect UNIX socket connections. Connections not associated with
    an IP address are treated as allowed, unconditionally.

## `raw_paste_global_conf`

**Command line:** `--paste-global CONF`

**Default:** `[]`

Set a PasteDeploy global config variable in ``key=value`` form.

The option can be specified multiple times.

The variables are passed to the PasteDeploy entrypoint. Example::

    $ gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:8000 --paste development.ini --paste-global FOO=1 --paste-global BAR=2

!!! info "Added in 19.7"

## `permit_obsolete_folding`

**Command line:** `--permit-obsolete-folding`

**Default:** `False`

Permit requests employing obsolete HTTP line folding mechanism

The folding mechanism was deprecated by rfc7230 Section 3.2.4 and will not be
 employed in HTTP request headers from standards-compliant HTTP clients.

This option is provided to diagnose backwards-incompatible changes.
Use with care and only if necessary. Temporary; the precise effect of this option may
change in a future version, or it may be removed altogether.

!!! info "Added in 23.0.0"

## `strip_header_spaces`

**Command line:** `--strip-header-spaces`

**Default:** `False`

Strip spaces present between the header name and the the ``:``.

This is known to induce vulnerabilities and is not compliant with the HTTP/1.1 standard.
See https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn.

Use with care and only if necessary. Deprecated; scheduled for removal in 25.0.0

!!! info "Added in 20.0.1"

## `permit_unconventional_http_method`

**Command line:** `--permit-unconventional-http-method`

**Default:** `False`

Permit HTTP methods not matching conventions, such as IANA registration guidelines

This permits request methods of length less than 3 or more than 20,
methods with lowercase characters or methods containing the # character.
HTTP methods are case sensitive by definition, and merely uppercase by convention.

If unset, Gunicorn will apply nonstandard restrictions and cause 400 response status
in cases where otherwise 501 status is expected. While this option does modify that
behaviour, it should not be depended upon to guarantee standards-compliant behaviour.
Rather, it is provided temporarily, to assist in diagnosing backwards-incompatible
changes around the incomplete application of those restrictions.

Use with care and only if necessary. Temporary; scheduled for removal in 24.0.0

!!! info "Added in 22.0.0"

## `permit_unconventional_http_version`

**Command line:** `--permit-unconventional-http-version`

**Default:** `False`

Permit HTTP version not matching conventions of 2023

This disables the refusal of likely malformed request lines.
It is unusual to specify HTTP 1 versions other than 1.0 and 1.1.

This option is provided to diagnose backwards-incompatible changes.
Use with care and only if necessary. Temporary; the precise effect of this option may
change in a future version, or it may be removed altogether.

!!! info "Added in 22.0.0"

## `casefold_http_method`

**Command line:** `--casefold-http-method`

**Default:** `False`

Transform received HTTP methods to uppercase

HTTP methods are case sensitive by definition, and merely uppercase by convention.

This option is provided because previous versions of gunicorn defaulted to this behaviour.

Use with care and only if necessary. Deprecated; scheduled for removal in 24.0.0

!!! info "Added in 22.0.0"

## `forwarder_headers`

**Command line:** `--forwarder-headers`

**Default:** `'SCRIPT_NAME,PATH_INFO'`

A list containing upper-case header field names that the front-end proxy
(see [forwarded-allow-ips](#forwarded_allow_ips)) sets, to be used in WSGI environment.

This option has no effect for headers not present in the request.

This option can be used to transfer ``SCRIPT_NAME``, ``PATH_INFO``
and ``REMOTE_USER``.

It is important that your front-end proxy configuration ensures that
the headers defined here can not be passed directly from the client.

## `header_map`

**Command line:** `--header-map`

**Default:** `'drop'`

Configure how header field names are mapped into environ

Headers containing underscores are permitted by RFC9110,
but gunicorn joining headers of different names into
the same environment variable will dangerously confuse applications as to which is which.

The safe default ``drop`` is to silently drop headers that cannot be unambiguously mapped.
The value ``refuse`` will return an error if a request contains *any* such header.
The value ``dangerous`` matches the previous, not advisable, behaviour of mapping different
header field names into the same environ name.

If the source is permitted as explained in [forwarded-allow-ips](#forwarded_allow_ips), *and* the header name is
present in [forwarder-headers](#forwarder_headers), the header is mapped into environment regardless of
the state of this setting.

Use with care and only if necessary and after considering if your problem could
instead be solved by specifically renaming or rewriting only the intended headers
on a proxy in front of Gunicorn.

!!! info "Added in 22.0.0"

# Server Socket

## `bind`

**Command line:** `-b ADDRESS`, `--bind ADDRESS`

**Default:** `['127.0.0.1:8000']`

The socket to bind.

A string of the form: ``HOST``, ``HOST:PORT``, ``unix:PATH``,
``fd://FD``. An IP is a valid ``HOST``.

!!! info "Changed in 20.0"
    Support for ``fd://FD`` got added.

Multiple addresses can be bound. ex.::

    $ gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:8000 -b [::1]:8000 test:app

will bind the `test:app` application on localhost both on ipv6
and ipv4 interfaces.

If the ``PORT`` environment variable is defined, the default
is ``['0.0.0.0:$PORT']``. If it is not defined, the default
is ``['127.0.0.1:8000']``.

## `backlog`

**Command line:** `--backlog INT`

**Default:** `2048`

The maximum number of pending connections.

This refers to the number of clients that can be waiting to be served.
Exceeding this number results in the client getting an error when
attempting to connect. It should only affect servers under significant
load.

Must be a positive integer. Generally set in the 64-2048 range.

# Worker Processes

## `workers`

**Command line:** `-w INT`, `--workers INT`

**Default:** `1`

The number of worker processes for handling requests.

A positive integer generally in the ``2-4 x $(NUM_CORES)`` range.
You'll want to vary this a bit to find the best for your particular
application's work load.

By default, the value of the ``WEB_CONCURRENCY`` environment variable,
which is set by some Platform-as-a-Service providers such as Heroku. If
it is not defined, the default is ``1``.

## `worker_class`

**Command line:** `-k STRING`, `--worker-class STRING`

**Default:** `'sync'`

The type of workers to use.

The default class (``sync``) should handle most "normal" types of
workloads. You'll want to read :doc:`design` for information on when
you might want to choose one of the other worker classes. Required
libraries may be installed using setuptools' ``extras_require`` feature.

A string referring to one of the following bundled classes:

* ``sync``
* ``eventlet`` - Requires eventlet >= 0.24.1 (or install it via
  ``pip install gunicorn[eventlet]``)
* ``gevent``   - Requires gevent >= 1.4 (or install it via
  ``pip install gunicorn[gevent]``)
* ``tornado``  - Requires tornado >= 0.2 (or install it via
  ``pip install gunicorn[tornado]``)
* ``gthread``  - Python 2 requires the futures package to be installed
  (or install it via ``pip install gunicorn[gthread]``)

Optionally, you can provide your own worker by giving Gunicorn a
Python path to a subclass of ``gunicorn.workers.base.Worker``.
This alternative syntax will load the gevent class:
``gunicorn.workers.ggevent.GeventWorker``.

## `threads`

**Command line:** `--threads INT`

**Default:** `1`

The number of worker threads for handling requests.

Run each worker with the specified number of threads.

A positive integer generally in the ``2-4 x $(NUM_CORES)`` range.
You'll want to vary this a bit to find the best for your particular
application's work load.

If it is not defined, the default is ``1``.

This setting only affects the Gthread worker type.

!!! note
    If you try to use the ``sync`` worker type and set the ``threads``
    setting to more than 1, the ``gthread`` worker type will be used
    instead.

## `worker_connections`

**Command line:** `--worker-connections INT`

**Default:** `1000`

The maximum number of simultaneous clients.

This setting only affects the ``gthread``, ``eventlet`` and ``gevent`` worker types.

## `max_requests`

**Command line:** `--max-requests INT`

**Default:** `0`

The maximum number of requests a worker will process before restarting.

Any value greater than zero will limit the number of requests a worker
will process before automatically restarting. This is a simple method
to help limit the damage of memory leaks.

If this is set to zero (the default) then the automatic worker
restarts are disabled.

## `max_requests_jitter`

**Command line:** `--max-requests-jitter INT`

**Default:** `0`

The maximum jitter to add to the *max_requests* setting.

The jitter causes the restart per worker to be randomized by
``randint(0, max_requests_jitter)``. This is intended to stagger worker
restarts to avoid all workers restarting at the same time.

!!! info "Added in 19.2"

## `timeout`

**Command line:** `-t INT`, `--timeout INT`

**Default:** `30`

Workers silent for more than this many seconds are killed and restarted.

Value is a positive number or 0. Setting it to 0 has the effect of
infinite timeouts by disabling timeouts for all workers entirely.

Generally, the default of thirty seconds should suffice. Only set this
noticeably higher if you're sure of the repercussions for sync workers.
For the non sync workers it just means that the worker process is still
communicating and is not tied to the length of time required to handle a
single request.

## `graceful_timeout`

**Command line:** `--graceful-timeout INT`

**Default:** `30`

Timeout for graceful workers restart in seconds.

After receiving a restart signal, workers have this much time to finish
serving requests. Workers still alive after the timeout (starting from
the receipt of the restart signal) are force killed.

## `keepalive`

**Command line:** `--keep-alive INT`

**Default:** `2`

The number of seconds to wait for requests on a Keep-Alive connection.

Generally set in the 1-5 seconds range for servers with direct connection
to the client (e.g. when you don't have separate load balancer). When
Gunicorn is deployed behind a load balancer, it often makes sense to
set this to a higher value.

!!! note
    ``sync`` worker does not support persistent connections and will
    ignore this option.
